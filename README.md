# GenRecall
Streamline the Recall process
*/The recall app is designed to contact a large number of people and receive their responses in real time quickly and efficiently. These responses are then stored on an online database for historical analysis. If a recall is generated by a supervisor, and an individual chooses "Distress," the individual's phone #, address, and location are sent to the supervisor for contact. See the flow chart for further information./*
